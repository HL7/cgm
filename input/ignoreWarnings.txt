# 02. Data Submitters POST CGM data as transaction Bundles to EHRs [base]/$submit-cgm-bundle. The Observation.performer element may be omitted in CGM profiles (i.e., Bundle entries) because the data is typically device-generated and the device is implicitly the performer. If needed, device information is captured through the Device resource and submitted as an entry in the CGM Data Submission Bundle.

Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer


# 03. After ballot resolution and sufficient testing, the CGM editors will submit this code to THO as suggested.

INFORMATION: CodeSystem/cgm: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)


# 05 This message refers to the Base FHIR R4 Bundle.language element which is not constrained in this IG.

# 06  CGM Data Submission Standing Order Profile and CGM Data Submission One Time Order Profile are derived from the Data Submission Standing Order Resource Profile and Data Submission Standing One Time Resource Profile respectively. Because of the profile derivation, the examples for the former also conforms to and thus are examples of the latter.

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cgm/StructureDefinition/data-submission-standing-order'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cgm/StructureDefinition/data-submission-one-time-order'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

# 07 We intentionally suppress narratives in this IG because narratives may not be meaningful or useful for resources generated by devices (e.g., lab instruments, CGM devices). The structured data is often sufficient for interpretation, and narratives do not add value in these contexts.

Constraint failed: dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)

# 08 In the Must Support Expectations for the CGM Data Submission Bundle section, we define the must support expectations for CGM Data Submission Bundle profile entries. They are all labeled as MS except for two pairs of Observation profiles that have molar and mass units options. However, any conformant implementation must support at least one of these options for each pair.
