# 03. After ballot resolution and sufficient testing, the CGM editors will submit this code to THO as suggested.

INFORMATION: CodeSystem/cgm: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# 04  As discussed in the guide's "Note on LOINC Codes" section (index.html#note-on-loinc-codes) This IG will use LOINC codes for all Observations and DiagnosticReports. LOINCs have been submitted, approved, and awaiting publication.

# 06  CGM Data Submission Standing Order Profile is derived from the Data Submission Standing Order Resource Profile.  Because of the profile derivation, the example for the former - CGM Data Submission Standing Order - also conforms to and thus is an example of the latter.

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cgm/StructureDefinition/data-submission-standing-order'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile
