# 02. Data Submitters POST CGM data as transaction Bundles to EHRs [base]/$submit-cgm-bundle. The Observation.performer element may be omitted in CGM profiles (i.e., Bundle entries) because the data is typically device-generated and the device is implicitly the performer. If needed, device information is captured through the Device resource and submitted as an entry in the CGM Data Submission Bundle.

Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer


# 03. After ballot resolution and sufficient testing, the CGM editors will submit this code to THO as suggested.

INFORMATION: CodeSystem/cgm: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)


# 05 This message refers to the FHIR F4 Bundle.language element which is not constrained in this IG.

INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/cgm-data-submission-bundle: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[4].binding.extension[0]: The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# 06  CGM Data Submission Standing Order Profile is derived from the Data Submission Standing Order Resource Profile.  Because of the profile derivation, the example for the former - CGM Data Submission Standing Order - also conforms to and thus is an example of the latter.

WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cgm/StructureDefinition/data-submission-standing-order'): The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile

# 07 WE intentionally suppress narratives in this IG because narratives may not be meaningful or useful for resources generated by devices (e.g., lab instruments, CGM devices). The structured data is often sufficient for interpretation, and narratives do not add value in these contexts.

Constraint failed: dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management' (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)

# 08 This message refers to the FHIR F4 ServiceRequest.locationCode element which is not constrained in this IG.

There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-ServiceDeliveryLocationRoleType'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer. Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2014-03-26, 3.0.0
